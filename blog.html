								<h3>Part 1 - The History, Popularization and Next Version of the Personal Storage Industry </h3>
								<p><img src="images/steve-johnson-541507-unsplash.jpg" width="30%" class="image left" >The early storage industry was ushered in by the Bekins brothers in the late 1800’s in Iowa, pioneering the concept of containerized storage. Today, a subsidiary of Bekins Van Lines, Bekins Moving and Storage Co. is a moving focused company that stores goods to facilitate domestic and international residential and business moves. </p>
								<p>The modern storage industry began in the late 60’s in the US, and has been popularized by reality TV shows like ‘Storage Wars’, ‘Auction Hunters’ and various similar shows that interact with aspects of the personal storage industry. Millions of people watching these types of shows can’t seem to get enough of the idea that people may find something priceless tucked away in a storage unit that’s remained sealed for years, or sometimes decades. </p>
							  <p>The next iteration and evolution of the personal storage industry is adding digital, on demand functionality to remove the work and time spent dealing with interacting with the traditional storage locker. The consumer can simply pack the items they’re looking to store, cataloguing them as they go, and send them off to storage with a transportation and storage provider who will visit their home to pickup and deliver the items. From there, through a mobile website or application, the consumer can interact in meaningful ways with their items. Recall, disposal, donation, positioning to sell through back end fulfillment services integrated with an online store,  or forwarding items to any serviceable address on the globe are all available via clicks or taps. </p>
								<p>This new level of convenience and flexibility gives consumers pathways to manage their items like never before. </p>
								<ul>
								<li>Seasonal decorations can now be sent off and recalled when needed or scheduled.</li>
								  <li>Renovations can be done with greater ease, as items can be staged for 1 or more months while the work is being completed and can be recalled by the box as rooms are ready.</li>
								  <li>Moving a home can be done in a more casual and less stressful way, ad boxes can arrive when it suits the homeowner, not all at once so they sit waiting to be unpacked, taking up a large amount of space.</li>
								  <li>Military personnel can stage their belongings between assignments, and have them delivered to wherever that new assignment may be.</li>
								  <li>Small businesses can store promotional items, or stage sales support items that can be delivered to field sales staff at whatever service level they choose. Marking end of seasons items for recycling as they expire.</li>
								  <li>Resellers and online merchants can now directly fulfill items they sell by forwarding items staged in order fulfillment warehouses that handle shipping and receiving to their buyers.</li>
								  </ul>

								  <p>And the list goes on. Consumers can be as creative as they like with their items, using any mix of all of the new features available, without being tied to a physical location or needing a vehicle to move their items around.</p>
